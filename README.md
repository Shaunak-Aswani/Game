In order to start - move your arrow keys

The goal is to reach the Goal; the blue square whilst avoiding the moving red squares - if the player touches a red square, one life will be taken and they will be taken back to the starting position.

The red squares size and starting position change with each round.

The player has 25 lives to make it before the game ends.
